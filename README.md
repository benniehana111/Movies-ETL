# Movies-ETL

### Purpose

The project goal was to build a dataset that can be used to predict which low budget movies will become popular on streaming platforms, allowing the Amazing Prime streaming service to purchase streaming rights to those films. 

### Dataset Construction

The project required conducting a complete Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) cycle on movie data from two sources; (1) a JSON file compiled by scraping Wikipedia pages on over 6,000 movies released since 1990, and (2) and a dataset with over 20 million movie ratings from the MovieLens website. This data was extracted from the source files, transformed into a single merged dataset, then loaded into a SQL database.

### Outcomes 

After performing the ETL process, the results were tested by examining the merged datasets; these results are displayed in the Dataframe printouts of the ETL Python scripts and the attached SQL screen captures.
